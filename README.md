# Spark Refresher

It's been a few years since I've regularly used Spark, and even back then it was with Scala. I was using ChatGPT to generate some practice materials in python for my own refresher and then pushed them up here for easier re-use.

You should have some experience with Spark as the exercises are more refresher than introduction.

Docker is used to run a container that already has Spark, Python, Jupyter, and useful packages pre-installed. The exercises are run through the Jupyter interface hosted by the container.
